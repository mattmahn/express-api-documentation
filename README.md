# express-api-documentation

This is a basic, sample project for comparing [Swagger][] and [apiDoc][]. The
`master` branch will only be the base API that I will start with. The `swagger`
and `apidoc` branches will be the implementations of those documentation tools
for this base ReST API.

[Swagger]: https://swagger.io/
[apiDoc]: http://apidocjs.com/
